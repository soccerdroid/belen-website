I currently work as a data scientist at the Analytics Department of AB-InBev. My research interests include Artificial Intelligence and Graph Theory, all applied in Social Good. I seek to get involved in the research and development of tools that impact positively to a community. 

I graduated as a Bachelor in Computer Science at [ESPOL](http://www.espol.edu.ec), where I ranked 3° (top 5%) in my promotion. During my studies, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Big Data Research Group and at the Center of Vision and Robotics, both at ESPOL. In the first one, I co-authored papers in the areas of public policy and risk management. In the latter, I worked with Image Processing and Computer Vision applied in AgTech projects. 

I was selected for an intership at Creative Commons through the Google Summer of Code program. I developed "The Linked Commons", a visualization of a force-directed graph, with data from Common Crawl. I later participated as a mentor. 

At AB-InBev, I work in the creation of models with different applications, such as credit scoring, which will bring an increase in net revenue for the company.
